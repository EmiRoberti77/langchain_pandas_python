# langchain_pandas_python

this code was actually originally a sample from 

https://github.com/ryanmark1867/langchain-pandas/blob/main/langchain_pandas.py

I could not get it to work on my machine so i made a change to the imports 
from langchain.agents import create_pandas_dataframe_agent
to
from langchain_experimental.agents.agent_toolkits import create_pandas_dataframe_agent
